penelope_parser
===============
Custom parser for https://github.com/pettarin/penelope

Useful for creating from-English distionaries using the Penelope tool.
The goal is to add different forms of english words (asked, asking, asks), which usually have 
very limited translations, as synonyms to main word "ask".
